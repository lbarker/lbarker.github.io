summary: Over the course of  a full redesign and adoption of the Jekyll framework,Lauren worked to distill most of the Campus Dining interface into a set of atomic pieces, forming the Cal Poly Campus Dining Styleguide. It's an internal guide & code repository for designing and coding at Campus Dining. The beauty and simplicity of this styleguide is that it's baked right into the JAMstack framework.
