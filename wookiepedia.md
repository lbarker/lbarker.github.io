summary: Over the course of a full redesign and adoption of Wordpress and a custom Divi Child Theme, lauren worked to distill most of the Cal Poly Corporation interface into a set of atomic pieces, forming The Wookiepedia. It's a internal guide & code repository for designing and coding at Cal Poly Corporation. The beauty and simplicity of the pattern library is that it's baked right into our Wordpress framework. Changes to our scss is tied to our website and the pattern library.
